aesop's
fables
the
cock
and
the
pearl
a
cock
was
once
strutting
up
and
down
the
farmyard
among
the
hens
when
suddenly
he
espied
something
shinning
amid
the
straw
ho
ho
quoth
he
that's
for
me
and
soon
rooted
it
out
from
beneath
the
straw
what
did
it
turn
out
to
be
but
a
pearl
that
by
some
chance
had
been
lost
in
the
yard
you
may
be
a
treasure
quoth
master
cock
to
men
that
prize
you
but
for
me
i
would
rather
have
a
single
barley
corn
than
a
peck
of
pearls
precious
things
are
for
those
that
can
prize
them
the
wolf
and
the
lamb
once
upon
a
time
a
wolf
was
lapping
at
a
spring
on
a
hillside
when
looking
up
what
should
he
see
but
a
lamb
just
beginning
to
drink
a
little
lower
down
there's
my
supper
thought
he
if
only
i
can
find
some
excuse
to
seize
it
then
he
called
out
to
the
lamb
how
dare
you
muddle
the
water
from
which
i
am
drinking
nay
master
nay
said
lambikin
if
the
water
be
muddy
up
there
i
cannot
be
the
cause
of
it
for
it
runs
down
from
you
to
me
well
then
said
the
wolf
why
did
you
call
me
bad
names
this
time
last
year
that
cannot
be
said
the
lamb
i
am
only
six
months
old
i
don't
care
snarled
the
wolf
if
it
was
not
you
it
was
your
father
and
with
that
he
rushed
upon
the
poor
little
lamb
and
warra
warra
warra
warra
warra
ate
her
all
up
but
before
she
died
she
gasped
out
any
excuse
will
serve
a
tyrant
the
dog
and
the
shadow
it
happened
that
a
dog
had
got
a
piece
of
meat
and
was
carrying
it
home
in
his
mouth
to
eat
it
in
peace
now
on
his
way
home
he
had
to
cross
a
plank
lying
across
a
running
brook
as
he
crossed
he
looked
down
and
saw
his
own
shadow
reflected
in
the
water
beneath
thinking
it
was
another
dog
with
another
piece
of
meat
he
made
up
his
mind
to
have
that
also
so
he
made
a
snap
at
the
shadow
in
the
water
but
as
he
opened
his
mouth
the
piece
of
meat
fell
out
dropped
into
the
water
and
was
never
seen
more
beware
lest
you
lose
the
substance
by
grasping
at
the
shadow
the
lion's
share
the
lion
went
once
a
hunting
along
with
the
fox
the
jackal
and
the
wolf
they
hunted
and
they
hunted
till
at
last
they
surprised
a
stag
and
soon
took
its
life
then
came
the
question
how
the
spoil
should
be
divided
quarter
me
this
stag
roared
the
lion
so
the
other
animals
skinned
it
and
cut
it
into
four
parts
then
the
lion
took
his
stand
in
front
of
the
carcass
and
pronounced
judgment
the
first
quarter
is
for
me
in
my
capacity
as
king
of
beasts
the
second
is
mine
as
arbiter
another
share
comes
to
me
for
my
part
in
the
chase
and
as
for
the
fourth
quarter
well
as
for
that
i
should
like
to
see
which
of
you
will
dare
to
lay
a
paw
upon
it
humph
grumbled
the
fox
as
he
walked
away
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
but
he
spoke
in
a
low
growl
you
may
share
the
labours
of
the
great
but
you
will
not
share
the
spoil
the
wolf
and
the
crane
a
wolf
had
been
gorging
on
an
animal
he
had
killed
when
suddenly
a
small
bone
in
the
meat
stuck
in
his
throat
and
he
could
not
swallow
it
he
soon
felt
terrible
pain
in
his
throat
and
ran
up
and
down
groaning
and
groaning
and
seeking
for
something
to
relieve
the
pain
he
tried
to
induce
every
one
he
met
to
remove
the
bone
i
would
give
anything
said
he
if
you
would
take
it
out
at
last
the
crane
agreed
to
try
and
told
the
wolf
to
lie
on
his
side
and
open
his
jaws
as
wide
as
he
could
then
the
crane
put
its
long
neck
down
the
wolf's
throat
and
with
its
beak
loosened
the
bone
till
at
last
it
got
it
out
will
you
kindly
give
me
the
reward
you
promised
said
the
crane
the
wolf
grinned
and
showed
his
teeth
and
said
be
content
you
have
put
your
head
inside
a
wolf's
mouth
and
taken
it
out
again
in
safety
that
ought
to
be
reward
enough
for
you
gratitude
and
greed
go
not
together
the
man
and
the
serpent
a
countryman's
son
by
accident
trod
upon
a
serpent's
tail
which
turned
and
bit
him
so
that
he
died
the
father
in
a
rage
got
his
axe
and
pursuing
the
serpent
cut
off
part
of
its
tail
so
the
serpent
in
revenge
began
stinging
several
of
the
farmer's
cattle
and
caused
him
severe
loss
well
the
farmer
thought
it
best
to
make
it
up
with
the
serpent
and
brought
food
and
honey
to
the
mouth
of
its
lair
and
said
to
it
let's
forget
and
forgive
perhaps
you
were
right
to
punish
my
son
and
take
vengeance
on
my
cattle
but
surely
i
was
right
in
trying
to
revenge
him
now
that
we
are
both
satisfied
why
should
not
we
be
friends
again
no
no
said
the
serpent
take
away
your
gifts
you
can
never
forget
the
death
of
your
son
nor
i
the
loss
of
my
tail
injuries
may
be
forgiven
but
not
forgotten
the
town
mouse
and
the
country
mouse
now
you
must
know
that
a
town
mouse
once
upon
a
time
went
on
a
visit
to
his
cousin
in
the
country
he
was
rough
and
ready
this
cousin
but
he
loved
his
town
friend
and
made
him
heartily
welcome
beans
and
bacon
cheese
and
bread
were
all
he
had
to
offer
but
he
offered
them
freely
the
town
mouse
rather
turned
up
his
long
nose
at
this
country
fare
and
said
i
cannot
understand
cousin
how
you
can
put
up
with
such
poor
food
as
this
but
of
course
you
cannot
expect
anything
better
in
the
country
come
you
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
how
to
live
when
you
have
been
in
town
a
week
you
will
wonder
how
you
could
ever
have
stood
a
country
life
no
sooner
said
than
done
the
two
mice
set
off
for
the
town
and
arrived
at
the
town
mouse's
residence
late
at
night
you
will
want
some
refreshment
after
our
long
journey
said
the
polite
town
mouse
and
took
his
friend
into
the
grand
dining
room
there
they
found
the
remains
of
a
fine
feast
and
soon
the
two
mice
were
eating
up
jellies
and
cakes
and
all
that
was
nice
suddenly
they
heard
growling
and
barking
what
is
that
said
the
country
mouse
it
is
only
the
dogs
of
the
house
answered
the
other
only
said
the
country
mouse
i
do
not
like
that
music
at
my
dinner
just
at
that
moment
the
door
flew
open
in
came
two
huge
mastiffs
and
the
two
mice
had
to
scamper
down
and
run
off
good
bye
cousin
said
the
country
mouse
what
going
so
soon
said
the
other
yes
he
replied
better
beans
and
bacon
in
peace
than
cakes
and
ale
in
fear
the
fox
and
the
crow
a
fox
once
saw
a
crow
fly
off
with
a
piece
of
cheese
in
its
beak
and
settle
on
a
branch
of
a
tree
that's
for
me
as
i
am
a
fox
said
master
reynard
and
he
walked
up
to
the
foot
of
the
tree
good
day
mistress
crow
he
cried
how
well
you
are
looking
to
day
how
glossy
your
feathers
how
bright
your
eye
i
feel
sure
your
voice
must
surpass
that
of
other
birds
just
as
your
figure
does
let
me
hear
but
one
song
from
you
that
i
may
greet
you
as
the
queen
of
birds
the
crow
lifted
up
her
head
and
began
to
caw
her
best
but
the
moment
she
opened
her
mouth
the
piece
of
cheese
fell
to
the
ground
only
to
be
snapped
up
by
master
fox
that
will
do
said
he
that
was
all
i
wanted
in
exchange
for
your
cheese
i
will
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
for
the
future
do
not
trust
flatterers
the
sick
lion
a
lion
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
days
and
lay
sick
unto
death
at
the
mouth
of
his
cave
gasping
for
breath
the
animals
his
subjects
came
round
him
and
drew
nearer
as
he
grew
more
and
more
helpless
when
they
saw
him
on
the
point
of
death
they
thought
to
themselves
now
is
the
time
to
pay
off
old
grudges
so
the
boar
came
up
and
drove
at
him
with
his
tusks
then
a
bull
gored
him
with
his
horns
still
the
lion
lay
helpless
before
them
so
the
ass
feeling
quite
safe
from
danger
came
up
and
turning
his
tail
to
the
lion
kicked
up
his
heels
into
his
face
this
is
a
double
death
growled
the
lion
only
cowards
insult
dying
majesty
the
ass
and
the
lapdog
a
farmer
one
day
came
to
the
stables
to
see
to
his
beasts
of
burden
among
them
was
his
favourite
ass
that
was
always
well
fed
and
often
carried
his
master
with
the
farmer
came
his
lapdog
who
danced
about
and
licked
his
hand
and
frisked
about
as
happy
as
could
be
the
farmer
felt
in
his
pocket
gave
the
lapdog
some
dainty
food
and
sat
down
while
he
gave
his
orders
to
his
servants
the
lapdog
jumped
into
his
master's
lap
and
lay
there
blinking
while
the
farmer
stroked
his
ears
the
ass
seeing
this
broke
loose
from
his
halter
and
commenced
prancing
about
in
imitation
of
the
lapdog
the
farmer
could
not
hold
his
sides
with
laughter
so
the
ass
went
up
to
him
and
putting
his
feet
upon
the
farmer's
shoulder
attempted
to
climb
into
his
lap
the
farmer's
servants
rushed
up
with
sticks
and
pitchforks
and
soon
taught
the
ass
that
clumsy
jesting
is
no
joke
the
lion
and
the
mouse
once
when
a
lion
was
asleep
a
little
mouse
began
running
up
and
down
upon
him
this
soon
wakened
the
lion
who
placed
his
huge
paw
upon
him
and
opened
his
big
jaws
to
swallow
him
pardon
o
king
cried
the
little
mouse
forgive
me
this
time
i
shall
never
forget
it
who
knows
but
what
i
may
be
able
to
do
you
a
turn
some
of
these
days
the
lion
was
so
tickled
at
the
idea
of
the
mouse
being
able
to
help
him
that
he
lifted
up
his
paw
and
let
him
go
some
time
after
the
lion
was
caught
in
a
trap
and
the
hunters
who
desired
to
carry
him
alive
to
the
king
tied
him
to
a
tree
while
they
went
in
search
of
a
waggon
to
carry
him
on
just
then
the
little
mouse
happened
to
pass
by
and
seeing
the
sad
plight
in
which
the
lion
was
went
up
to
him
and
soon
gnawed
away
the
ropes
that
bound
the
king
of
the
beasts
was
i
not
right
said
the
little
mouse
little
friends
may
prove
great
friends
the
swallow
and
the
other
birds
it
happened
that
a
countryman
was
sowing
some
hemp
seeds
in
a
field
where
a
swallow
and
some
other
birds
were
hopping
about
picking
up
their
food
beware
of
that
man
quoth
the
swallow
why
what
is
he
doing
said
the
others
that
is
hemp
seed
he
is
sowing
be
careful
to
pick
up
every
one
of
the
seeds
or
else
you
will
repent
it
the
birds
paid
no
heed
to
the
swallow's
words
and
by
and
by
the
hemp
grew
up
and
was
made
into
cord
and
of
the
cords
nets
were
made
and
many
a
bird
that
had
despised
the
swallow's
advice
was
caught
in
nets
made
out
of
that
very
hemp
what
did
i
tell
you
said
the
swallow
destroy
the
seed
of
evil
or
it
will
grow
up
to
your
ruin
the
frogs
desiring
a
king
the
frogs
were
living
as
happy
as
could
be
in
a
marshy
swamp
that
just
suited
them
they
went
splashing
about
caring
for
nobody
and
nobody
troubling
with
them
but
some
of
them
thought
that
this
was
not
right
that
they
should
have
a
king
and
a
proper
constitution
so
they
determined
to
send
up
a
petition
to
jove
to
give
them
what
they
wanted
mighty
jove
they
cried
send
unto
us
a
king
that
will
rule
over
us
and
keep
us
in
order
jove
laughed
at
their
croaking
and
threw
down
into
the
swamp
a
huge
log
which
came
downrplashto
the
swamp
the
frogs
were
frightened
out
of
their
lives
by
the
commotion
made
in
their
midst
and
all
rushed
to
the
bank
to
look
at
the
horrible
monster
but
after
a
time
seeing
that
it
did
not
move
one
or
two
of
the
boldest
of
them
ventured
out
towards
the
log
and
even
dared
to
touch
it
still
it
did
not
move
then
the
greatest
hero
of
the
frogs
jumped
upon
the
log
and
commenced
dancing
up
and
down
upon
it
thereupon
all
the
frogs
came
and
did
the
same
and
for
some
time
the
frogs
went
about
their
business
every
day
without
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
their
new
king
log
lying
in
their
midst
but
this
did
not
suit
them
so
they
sent
another
petition
to
jove
and
said
to
him
we
want
a
real
king
one
that
will
really
rule
over
us
now
this
made
jove
angry
so
he
sent
among
them
a
big
stork
that
soon
set
to
work
gobbling
them
all
up
then
the
frogs
repented
when
too
late
better
no
rule
than
cruel
rule
the
mountains
in
labour
one
day
the
countrymen
noticed
that
the
mountains
were
in
labour
smoke
came
out
of
their
summits
the
earth
was
quaking
at
their
feet
trees
were
crashing
and
huge
rocks
were
tumbling
they
felt
sure
that
something
horrible
was
going
to
happen
they
all
gathered
together
in
one
place
to
see
what
terrible
thing
this
could
be
they
waited
and
they
waited
but
nothing
came
at
last
there
was
a
still
more
violent
earthquake
and
a
huge
gap
appeared
in
the
side
of
the
mountains
they
all
fell
down
upon
their
knees
and
waited
at
last
and
at
last
a
teeny
tiny
mouse
poked
its
little
head
and
bristles
out
of
the
gap
and
came
running
down
towards
them
and
ever
after
they
used
to
say
much
outcry
little
outcome
the
hares
and
the
frogs
the
hares
were
so
persecuted
by
the
other
beasts
they
did
not
know
where
to
go
as
soon
as
they
saw
a
single
animal
approach
them
off
they
used
to
run
one
day
they
saw
a
troop
of
wild
horses
stampeding
about
and
in
quite
a
panic
all
the
hares
scuttled
off
to
a
lake
hard
by
determined
to
drown
themselves
rather
than
live
in
such
a
continual
state
of
fear
but
just
as
they
got
near
the
bank
of
the
lake
a
troop
of
frogs
frightened
in
their
turn
by
the
approach
of
the
hares
scuttled
off
and
jumped
into
the
water
truly
said
one
of
the
hares
things
are
not
so
bad
as
they
seem
there
is
always
someone
worse
off
than
yourself
the
wolf
and
the
kid
a
kid
was
perched
up
on
the
top
of
a
house
and
looking
down
saw
a
wolf
passing
under
him
immediately
he
began
to
revile
and
attack
his
enemy
murderer
and
thief
he
cried
what
do
you
here
near
honest
folks'
houses
how
dare
you
make
an
appearance
where
your
vile
deeds
are
known
curse
away
my
young
friend
said
the
wolf
it
is
easy
to
be
brave
from
a
safe
distance
the
woodman
and
the
serpent
one
wintry
day
a
woodman
was
tramping
home
from
his
work
when
he
saw
something
black
lying
on
the
snow
when
he
came
closer
he
saw
it
was
a
serpent
to
all
appearance
dead
but
he
took
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
bosom
to
warm
while
he
hurried
home
as
soon
as
he
got
indoors
he
put
the
serpent
down
on
the
hearth
before
the
fire
the
children
watched
it
and
saw
it
slowly
come
to
life
again
then
one
of
them
stooped
down
to
stroke
it
but
thc
serpent
raised
its
head
and
put
out
its
fangs
and
was
about
to
sting
the
child
to
death
so
the
woodman
seized
his
axe
and
with
one
stroke
cut
the
serpent
in
two
ah
said
he
no
gratitude
from
the
wicked
the
bald
man
and
the
fly
there
was
once
a
bald
man
who
sat
down
after
work
on
a
hot
summer's
day
a
fly
came
up
and
kept
buzzing
about
his
bald
pate
and
stinging
him
from
time
to
time
the
man
aimed
a
blow
at
his
little
enemy
but
acks
palm
came
on
his
head
instead
again
the
fly
tormented
him
but
this
time
the
man
was
wiser
and
said
you
will
only
injure
yourself
if
you
take
notice
of
despicable
enemies
the
fox
and
the
stork
at
one
time
the
fox
and
the
stork
were
on
visiting
terms
and
seemed
very
good
friends
so
the
fox
invited
the
stork
to
dinner
and
for
a
joke
put
nothing
before
her
but
some
soup
in
a
very
shallow
dish
this
the
fox
could
easily
lap
up
but
the
stork
could
only
wet
the
end
of
her
long
bill
in
it
and
left
the
meal
as
hungry
as
when
she
began
i
am
sorry
said
the
fox
the
soup
is
not
to
your
liking
pray
do
not
apologise
said
the
stork
i
hope
you
will
return
this
visit
and
come
and
dine
with
me
soon
so
a
day
was
appointed
when
the
fox
should
visit
the
stork
but
when
they
were
seated
at
table
all
that
was
for
their
dinner
was
contained
in
a
very
long
necked
jar
with
a
narrow
mouth
in
which
the
fox
could
not
insert
his
snout
so
all
he
could
manage
to
do
was
to
lick
the
outside
of
the
jar
i
will
not
apologise
for
the
dinner
said
the
stork
one
bad
turn
deserves
another
the
fox
and
the
mask
a
fox
had
by
some
means
got
into
the
store
room
of
a
theatre
suddenly
he
observed
a
face
glaring
down
on
him
and
began
to
be
very
frightened
but
looking
more
closely
he
found
it
was
only
a
mask
such
as
actors
use
to
put
over
their
face
ah
said
the
fox
you
look
very
fine
it
is
a
pity
you
have
not
got
any
brains
outside
show
is
a
poor
substitute
for
inner
worth
the
jay
and
the
peacock
a
jay
venturing
into
a
yard
where
peacocks
used
to
walk
found
there
a
number
of
feathers
which
had
fallen
from
the
peacocks
when
they
were
moulting
he
tied
them
all
to
his
tail
and
strutted
down
towards
the
peacocks
when
he
came
near
them
they
soon
discovered
the
cheat
and
striding
up
to
him
pecked
at
him
and
plucked
away
his
borrowed
plumes
so
the
jay
could
do
no
better
than
go
back
to
the
other
jays
who
had
watched
his
behaviour
from
a
distance
but
they
were
equally
annoyed
with
him
and
told
him
it
is
not
only
fine
feathers
that
make
fine
birds
the
frog
and
the
ox
oh
father
said
a
little
frog
to
the
big
one
sitting
by
the
side
of
a
pool
i
have
seen
such
a
terrible
monster
it
was
as
big
as
a
mountain
with
horns
on
its
head
and
a
long
tail
and
it
had
hoofs
divided
in
two
tush
child
tush
said
the
old
frog
that
was
only
farmer
white's
ox
it
isn't
so
big
either
he
may
be
a
little
bit
taller
than
i
but
i
could
easily
make
myself
quite
as
broad
just
you
see
so
he
blew
himself
out
and
blew
himself
out
and
blew
himself
out
was
he
as
big
as
that
asked
he
oh
much
bigger
than
that
said
the
young
frog
again
the
old
one
blew
himself
out
and
asked
the
young
one
if
the
ox
was
as
big
as
that
bigger
father
bigger
was
the
reply
so
the
frog
took
a
deep
breath
and
blew
and
blew
and
blew
and
swelled
and
swelled
and
swelled
and
then
he
said
i'm
sure
the
ox
is
not
as
big
asbut
at
this
moment
he
burst
self
conceit
may
lead
to
self
destruction
androcles
a
slave
named
androcles
once
escaped
from
his
master
and
fled
to
the
forest
as
he
was
wandering
about
there
he
came
upon
a
lion
lying
down
moaning
and
groaning
at
first
he
turned
to
flee
but
finding
that
the
lion
did
not
pursue
him
he
turned
back
and
went
up
to
him
as
he
came
near
the
lion
put
out
his
paw
which
was
all
swollen
and
bleeding
and
androcles
found
that
a
huge
thorn
had
got
into
it
and
was
causing
all
the
pain
he
pulled
out
the
thorn
and
bound
up
the
paw
of
the
lion
who
was
soon
able
to
rise
and
lick
the
hand
of
androcles
like
a
dog
then
the
lion
took
androcles
to
his
cave
and
every
day
used
to
bring
him
meat
from
which
to
live
but
shortly
afterwards
both
androcles
and
the
lion
were
captured
and
the
slave
was
sentenced
to
be
thrown
to
the
lion
after
the
latter
had
been
kept
without
food
for
several
days
the
emperor
and
all
his
court
came
to
see
the
spectacle
and
androcles
was
led
out
into
the
middle
of
the
arena
soon
the
lion
was
let
loose
from
his
den
and
rushed
bounding
and
roaring
towards
his
victim
but
as
soon
as
he
came
near
to
androcles
he
recognised
his
friend
and
fawned
upon
him
and
licked
his
hands
like
a
friendly
dog
the
emperor
surprised
at
this
summoned
androcles
to
him
who
told
him
the
whole
story
whereupon
the
slave
was
pardoned
and
freed
and
the
lion
let
loose
to
his
native
forest
gratitude
is
the
sign
of
noble
souls
the
bat
the
birds
and
the
beasts
a
great
conflict
was
about
to
come
off
between
the
birds
and
the
beasts
when
the
two
armies
were
collected
together
the
bat
hesitated
which
to
join
the
birds
that
passed
his
perch
said
come
with
us
but
he
said
i
am
a
beast
later
on
some
beasts
who
were
passing
underneath
him
looked
up
and
said
come
with
us
but
he
said
i
am
a
bird
luckily
at
the
last
moment
peace
was
made
and
no
battle
took
place
so
the
bat
came
to
the
birds
and
wished
to
join
in
the
rejoicings
but
they
all
turned
against
him
and
he
had
to
fly
away
he
then
went
to
the
beasts
but
soon
had
to
beat
a
retreat
or
else
they
would
have
torn
him
to
pieces
ah
said
the
bat
i
see
now
he
that
is
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
has
no
friends
the
hart
and
the
hunter
the
hart
was
once
drinking
from
a
pool
and
admiring
the
noble
figure
he
made
there
ah
said
he
where
can
you
see
such
noble
horns
as
these
with
such
antlers
i
wish
i
had
legs
more
worthy
to
bear
such
a
noble
crown
it
is
a
pity
they
are
so
slim
and
slight
at
that
moment
a
hunter
approached
and
sent
an
arrow
whistling
after
him
away
bounded
the
hart
and
soon
by
the
aid
of
his
nimble
legs
was
nearly
out
of
sight
of
the
hunter
but
not
noticing
where
he
was
going
he
passed
under
some
trees
with
branches
growing
low
down
in
which
his
antlers
were
caught
so
that
the
hunter
had
time
to
come
up
alas
alas
cried
the
hart
we
often
despise
what
is
most
useful
to
us
the
serpent
and
the
file
a
serpent
in
the
course
of
its
wanderings
came
into
an
armourer's
shop
as
he
glided
over
the
floor
he
felt
his
skin
pricked
by
a
file
lying
there
in
a
rage
he
turned
round
upon
it
and
tried
to
dart
his
fangs
into
it
but
he
could
do
no
harm
to
heavy
iron
and
had
soon
to
give
over
his
wrath
it
is
useless
attacking
the
insensible
the
man
and
the
wood
a
man
came
into
a
wood
one
day
with
an
axe
in
his
hand
and
begged
all
the
trees
to
give
him
a
small
branch
which
he
wanted
for
a
particular
purpose
the
trees
were
good
natured
and
gave
him
one
of
their
branches
what
did
the
man
do
but
fix
it
into
the
axe
head
and
soon
set
to
work
cutting
down
tree
after
tree
then
the
trees
saw
how
foolish
they
had
been
in
giving
their
enemy
the
means
of
destroying
themselves
the
dog
and
the
wolf
a
gaunt
wolf
was
almost
dead
with
hunger
when
he
happened
to
meet
a
house
dog
who
was
passing
by
ah
cousin
said
the
dog
i
knew
how
it
would
be
your
irregular
life
will
soon
be
the
ruin
of
you
why
do
you
not
work
steadily
as
i
do
and
get
your
food
regularly
given
to
you
i
would
have
no
objection
said
the
wolf
if
i
could
only
get
a
place
i
will
easily
arrange
that
for
you
said
the
dog
come
with
me
to
my
master
and
you
shall
share
my
work
so
the
wolf
and
the
dog
went
towards
the
town
together
on
the
way
there
the
wolf
noticed
that
the
hair
on
a
certain
part
of
the
dog's
neck
was
very
much
worn
away
so
he
asked
him
how
that
had
come
about
oh
it
is
nothing
said
the
dog
that
is
only
the
place
where
the
collar
is
put
on
at
night
to
keep
me
chained
up
it
chafes
a
bit
but
one
soon
gets
used
to
it
is
that
all
said
the
wolf
then
good
bye
to
you
master
dog
better
starve
free
than
be
a
fat
slave
the
belly
and
the
members
one
fine
day
it
occurred
to
the
members
of
the
body
that
they
were
doing
all
the
work
and
the
belly
was
having
all
the
food
so
they
held
a
meeting
and
after
a
long
discussion
decided
to
strike
work
till
the
belly
consented
to
take
its
proper
share
of
the
work
so
for
a
day
or
two
the
hands
refused
to
take
the
food
the
mouth
refused
to
receive
it
and
the
teeth
had
no
work
to
do
but
after
a
day
or
two
the
members
began
to
find
that
they
themselves
were
not
in
a
very
active
condition
the
hands
could
hardly
move
and
the
mouth
was
all
parched
and
dry
while
the
legs
were
unable
to
support
the
rest
so
thus
they
found
that
even
the
belly
in
its
dull
quiet
way
was
doing
necessary
work
for
the
body
and
that
all
must
work
together
or
the
body
will
go
to
pieces
the
hart
in
the
ox
stall
a
hart
hotly
pursued
by
the
hounds
fled
for
refuge
into
an
ox
stall
and
buried
itself
in
a
truss
of
hay
leaving
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
tips
of
his
horns
soon
after
the
hunters
came
up
and
asked
if
any
one
had
seen
the
hart
the
stable
boys
who
had
been
resting
after
their
dinner
looked
round
but
could
see
nothing
and
the
hunters
went
away
shortly
afterwards
the
master
came
in
and
looking
round
saw
that
something
unusual
had
taken
place
he
pointed
to
the
truss
of
hay
and
said
what
are
those
two
curious
things
sticking
out
of
the
hay
and
when
the
stable
boys
came
to
look
they
discovered
the
hart
and
soon
made
an
end
of
him
he
thus
learnt
that
nothing
escapes
the
master's
eye
the
fox
and
the
grapes
one
hot
summer's
day
a
fox
was
strolling
through
an
orchard
till
he
came
to
a
bunch
of
grapes
just
ripening
on
a
vine
which
had
been
trained
over
a
lofty
branch
just
the
thing
to
quench
my
thirst
quoth
he
drawing
back
a
few
paces
he
took
a
run
and
a
jump
and
just
missed
the
bunch
turning
round
again
with
a
one
two
three
he
jumped
up
but
with
no
greater
success
again
and
again
he
tried
after
the
tempting
morsel
but
at
last
had
to
give
it
up
and
walked
away
with
his
nose
in
the
air
saying
i
am
sure
they
are
sour
it
is
easy
to
despise
what
you
cannot
get
the
horse
hunter
and
stag
a
quarrel
had
arisen
between
the
horse
and
the
stag
so
the
horse
came
to
a
hunter
to
ask
his
help
to
take
revenge
on
the
stag
the
hunter
agreed
but
said
if
you
desire
to
conquer
the
stag
you
must
permit
me
to
place
this
piece
of
iron
between
your
jaws
so
that
i
may
guide
you
with
these
reins
and
allow
this
saddle
to
be
placed
upon
your
back
so
that
i
may
keep
steady
upon
you
as
we
follow
after
the
enemy
the
horse
agreed
to
the
conditions
and
the
hunter
soon
saddled
and
bridled
him
then
with
the
aid
of
the
hunter
the
horse
soon
overcame
the
stag
and
said
to
the
hunter
now
get
off
and
remove
those
things
from
my
mouth
and
back
not
so
fast
friend
said
the
hunter
i
have
now
got
you
under
bit
and
spur
and
prefer
to
keep
you
as
you
are
at
present
if
you
allow
men
to
use
you
for
your
own
purposes
they
will
use
you
for
theirs
the
peacock
and
juno
a
peacock
once
placed
a
petition
before
juno
desiring
to
have
the
voice
of
a
nightingale
in
addition
to
his
other
attractions
but
juno
refused
his
request
when
he
persisted
and
pointed
out
that
he
was
her
favourite
bird
she
said
be
content
with
your
lot
one
cannot
be
first
in
everything
the
fox
and
the
lion
when
first
the
fox
saw
the
lion
he
was
terribly
frightened
and
ran
away
and
hid
himself
in
the
wood
next
time
however
he
came
near
the
king
of
beasts
he
stopped
at
a
safe
distance
and
watched
him
pass
by
the
third
time
they
came
near
one
another
the
fox
went
straight
up
to
the
lion
and
passed
the
time
of
day
with
him
asking
him
how
his
family
were
and
when
he
should
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
again
then
turning
his
tail
he
parted
from
the
lion
without
much
ceremony
familiarity
breeds
contempt
the
lion
and
the
statue
a
man
and
a
lion
were
discussing
the
relative
strength
of
men
and
lions
in
general
the
man
contended
that
he
and
his
fellows
were
stronger
than
lions
by
reason
of
their
greater
intelligence
come
now
with
me
he
cried
and
i
will
soon
prove
that
i
am
right
so
he
took
him
into
the
public
gardens
and
showed
him
a
statue
of
hercules
overcoming
the
lion
and
tearing
his
mouth
in
two
that
is
all
very
well
said
the
lion
but
proves
nothing
for
it
was
a
man
who
made
the
statue
we
can
easily
represent
things
as
we
wish
them
to
be
the
ant
and
the
grasshopper
in
a
field
one
summer's
day
a
grasshopper
was
hopping
about
chirping
and
singing
to
its
heart's
content
an
ant
passed
by
bearing
along
with
great
toil
an
ear
of
corn
he
was
taking
to
the
nest
why
not
come
and
chat
with
me
said
the
grasshopper
instead
of
toiling
and
moiling
in
that
way
i
am
helping
to
lay
up
food
for
the
winter
said
the
ant
and
recommend
you
to
do
the
same
why
bother
about
winter
said
the
grasshopper
we
have
got
plenty
of
food
at
present
but
the
ant
went
on
its
way
and
continued
its
toil
when
the
winter
came
the
grasshopper
had
no
food
and
found
itself
dying
of
hunger
while
it
saw
the
ants
distributing
every
day
corn
and
grain
from
the
stores
they
had
collected
in
the
summer
then
the
grasshopper
knew
it
is
best
to
prepare
for
the
days
of
necessity
the
tree
and
the
reed
well
little
one
said
a
tree
to
a
reed
that
was
growing
at
its
foot
why
do
you
not
plant
your
feet
deeply
in
the
ground
and
raise
your
head
boldly
in
the
air
as
i
do
i
am
contented
with
my
lot
said
the
reed
i
may
not
be
so
grand
but
i
think
i
am
safer
safe
sneered
the
tree
who
shall
pluck
me
up
by
the
roots
or
bow
my
head
to
the
ground
but
it
soon
had
to
repent
of
its
boasting
for
a
hurricane
arose
which
tore
it
up
from
its
roots
and
cast
it
a
useless
log
on
the
ground
while
the
little
reed
bending
to
the
force
of
the
wind
soon
stood
upright
again
when
the
storm
had
passed
over
obscurity
often
brings
safety
the
fox
and
the
cat
a
fox
was
boasting
to
a
cat
of
its
clever
devices
for
escaping
its
enemies
i
have
a
whole
bag
of
tricks
he
said
which
contains
a
hundred
ways
of
escaping
my
enemies
i
have
only
one
said
the
cat
but
i
can
generally
manage
with
that
just
at
that
moment
they
heard
the
cry
of
a
pack
of
hounds
coming
towards
them
and
the
cat
immediately
scampered
up
a
tree
and
hid
herself
in
the
boughs
this
is
my
plan
said
the
cat
what
are
you
going
to
do
the
fox
thought
first
of
one
way
then
of
another
and
while
he
was
debating
the
hounds
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
at
last
the
fox
in
his
confusion
was
caught
up
by
the
hounds
and
soon
killed
by
the
huntsmen
miss
puss
who
had
been
looking
on
said
better
one
safe
way
than
a
hundred
on
which
you
cannot
reckon
the
wolf
in
sheep's
clothing
a
wolf
found
great
difficulty
in
getting
at
the
sheep
owing
to
the
vigilance
of
the
shepherd
and
his
dogs
but
one
day
it
found
the
skin
of
a
sheep
that
had
been
flayed
and
thrown
aside
so
it
put
it
on
over
its
own
pelt
and
strolled
down
among
the
sheep
the
lamb
that
belonged
to
the
sheep
whose
skin
the
wolf
was
wearing
began
to
follow
the
wolf
in
the
sheep's
clothing
so
leading
the
lamb
a
little
apart
he
soon
made
a
meal
off
her
and
for
some
time
he
succeeded
in
deceiving
the
sheep
and
enjoying
hearty
meals
appearances
are
deceptive
the
dog
in
the
manger
a
dog
looking
out
for
its
afternoon
nap
jumped
into
the
manger
of
an
ox
and
lay
there
cosily
upon
the
straw
but
soon
the
ox
returning
from
its
afternoon
work
came
up
to
the
manger
and
wanted
to
eat
some
of
the
straw
the
dog
in
a
rage
being
awakened
from
its
slumber
stood
up
and
barked
at
the
ox
and
whenever
it
came
near
attempted
to
bite
it
at
last
the
ox
had
to
give
up
the
hope
of
getting
at
the
straw
and
went
away
muttering
ah
people
often
grudge
others
what
they
cannot
enjoy
themselves
the
man
and
the
wooden
god
in
the
old
days
men
used
to
worship
stocks
and
stones
and
idols
and
prayed
to
them
to
give
them
luck
it
happened
that
a
man
had
often
prayed
to
a
wooden
idol
he
had
received
from
his
father
but
his
luck
never
seemed
to
change
he
prayed
and
he
prayed
but
still
he
remained
as
unlucky
as
ever
one
day
in
the
greatest
rage
he
went
to
the
wooden
god
and
with
one
blow
swept
it
down
from
its
pedestal
the
idol
broke
in
two
and
what
did
he
see
an
immense
number
of
coins
flying
all
over
the
place
the
fisher
a
fisher
once
took
his
bagpipes
to
the
bank
of
a
river
and
played
upon
them
with
the
hope
of
making
the
fish
rise
but
never
a
one
put
his
nose
out
of
the
water
so
he
cast
his
net
into
the
river
and
soon
drew
it
forth
filled
with
fish
then
he
took
his
bagpipes
again
and
as
he
played
the
fish
leapt
up
in
the
net
ah
you
dance
now
when
i
play
said
he
yes
said
an
old
fish
when
you
are
in
a
man's
power
you
must
do
as
he
bids
you
the
shepherd's
boy
there
was
once
a
young
shepherd
boy
who
tended
his
sheep
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
near
a
dark
forest
it
was
rather
lonely
for
him
all
day
so
he
thought
upon
a
plan
by
which
he
could
get
a
little
company
and
some
excitement
he
rushed
down
towards
the
village
calling
out
wolf
wolf
and
the
villagers
came
out
to
meet
him
and
some
of
them
stopped
with
him
for
a
considerable
time
this
pleased
the
boy
so
much
that
a
few
days
afterwards
he
tried
the
same
trick
and
again
the
villagers
came
to
his
help
but
shortly
after
this
a
wolf
actually
did
come
out
from
the
forest
and
began
to
worry
the
sheep
and
the
boy
of
course
cried
out
wolf
wolf
still
louder
than
before
but
this
time
the
villagers
who
had
been
fooled
twice
before
thought
the
boy
was
again
deceiving
them
and
nobody
stirred
to
come
to
his
help
so
the
wolf
made
a
good
meal
off
the
boy's
flock
and
when
the
boy
complained
the
wise
man
of
the
village
said
a
liar
will
not
be
believed
even
when
he
speaks
the
truth
the
young
thief
and
his
mother
a
young
man
had
been
caught
in
a
daring
act
of
theft
and
had
been
condemned
to
be
executed
for
it
he
expressed
his
desire
to
see
his
mother
and
to
speak
with
her
before
he
was
led
to
execution
and
of
course
this
was
granted
when
his
mother
came
to
him
he
said
i
want
to
whisper
to
you
and
when
she
brought
her
ear
near
him
he
nearly
bit
it
off
all
the
bystanders
were
horrified
and
asked
him
what
he
could
mean
by
such
brutal
and
inhuman
conduct
it
is
to
punish
her
he
said
when
i
was
young
i
began
with
stealing
little
things
and
brought
them
home
to
mother
instead
of
rebuking
and
punishing
me
she
laughed
and
said
it
will
not
be
noticed
it
is
because
of
her
that
i
am
here
to
day
he
is
right
woman
said
the
priest
the
lord
hath
said
train
up
a
child
in
the
way
he
should
go
and
when
he
is
old
he
will
not
depart
therefrom
the
man
and
his
two
wives
in
the
old
days
when
men
were
allowed
to
have
many
wives
a
middle
aged
man
had
one
wife
that
was
old
and
one
that
was
young
each
loved
him
very
much
and
desired
to
see
him
like
herself
now
the
man's
hair
was
turning
grey
which
the
young
wife
did
not
like
as
it
made
him
look
too
old
for
her
husband
so
every
night
she
used
to
comb
his
hair
and
pick
out
the
white
ones
but
the
elder
wife
saw
her
husband
growing
grey
with
great
pleasure
for
she
did
not
like
to
be
mistaken
for
his
mother
so
every
morning
she
used
to
arrange
his
hair
and
pick
out
as
many
of
the
black
ones
as
she
could
the
consequence
was
the
man
soon
found
himself
entirely
bald
yield
to
all
and
you
will
soon
have
nothing
to
yield
the
nurse
and
the
wolf
be
quiet
now
said
an
old
nurse
to
a
child
sitting
on
her
lap
if
you
make
that
noise
again
i
will
throw
you
to
the
wolf
now
it
chanced
that
a
wolf
was
passing
close
under
the
window
as
this
was
said
so
he
crouched
down
by
the
side
of
the
house
and
waited
i
am
in
good
luck
to
day
thought
he
it
is
sure
to
cry
soon
and
a
daintier
morsel
i
haven't
had
for
many
a
long
day
so
he
waited
and
he
waited
and
he
waited
till
at
last
the
child
began
to
cry
and
the
wolf
came
forward
before
the
window
and
looked
up
to
the
nurse
wagging
his
tail
but
all
the
nurse
did
was
to
shut
down
the
window
and
call
for
help
and
the
dogs
of
the
house
came
rushing
out
ah
said
the
wolf
as
he
galloped
away
enemies
promises
were
made
to
be
broken
the
tortoise
and
the
birds
a
tortoise
desired
to
change
its
place
of
residence
so
he
asked
an
eagle
to
carry
him
to
his
new
home
promising
her
a
rich
reward
for
her
trouble
the
eagle
agreed
and
seizing
the
tortoise
by
the
shell
with
her
talons
soared
aloft
on
their
way
they
met
a
crow
who
said
to
the
eagle
tortoise
is
good
eating
the
shell
is
too
hard
said
the
eagle
in
reply
the
rocks
will
soon
crack
the
shell
was
the
crow's
answer
and
the
eagle
taking
the
hint
let
fall
the
tortoise
on
a
sharp
rock
and
the
two
birds
made
a
hearty
meal
of
the
tortoise
never
soar
aloft
on
an
enemy's
pinions
the
two
crabs
one
fine
day
two
crabs
came
out
from
their
home
to
take
a
stroll
on
the
sand
child
said
the
mother
you
are
walking
very
ungracefully
you
should
accustom
yourself
to
walking
straight
forward
without
twisting
from
side
to
side
pray
mother
said
the
young
one
do
but
set
the
example
yourself
and
i
will
follow
you
example
is
the
best
precept
the
ass
in
the
lion's
skin
an
ass
once
found
a
lion's
skin
which
the
hunters
had
left
out
in
the
sun
to
dry
he
put
it
on
and
went
towards
his
native
village
all
fled
at
his
approach
both
men
and
animals
and
he
was
a
proud
ass
that
day
in
his
delight
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
brayed
but
then
every
one
knew
him
and
his
owner
came
up
and
gave
him
a
sound
cudgelling
for
the
fright
he
had
caused
and
shortly
afterwards
a
fox
came
up
to
him
and
said
ah
i
knew
you
by
your
voice
fine
clothes
may
disguise
but
silly
words
will
disclose
a
fool
the
two
fellows
and
the
bear
two
fellows
were
travelling
together
through
a
wood
when
a
bear
rushed
out
upon
them
one
of
the
travellers
happened
to
be
in
front
and
he
seized
hold
of
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
hid
himself
among
the
leaves
the
other
seeing
no
help
for
it
threw
himself
flat
down
upon
the
ground
with
his
face
in
the
dust
the
bear
coming
up
to
him
put
his
muzzle
close
to
his
ear
and
sniffed
and
sniffed
but
at
last
with
a
growl
he
shook
his
head
and
slouched
off
for
bears
will
not
touch
dead
meat
then
the
fellow
in
the
tree
came
down
to
his
comrade
and
laughing
said
what
was
it
that
master
bruin
whispered
to
you
he
told
me
said
the
other
never
trust
a
friend
who
deserts
you
at
a
pinch
the
two
pots
two
pots
had
been
left
on
the
bank
of
a
river
one
of
brass
and
one
of
earthenware
when
the
tide
rose
they
both
floated
off
down
the
stream
now
the
earthenware
pot
tried
its
best
to
keep
aloof
from
the
brass
one
which
cried
out
fear
nothing
friend
i
will
not
strike
you
but
i
may
come
in
contact
with
you
said
the
other
if
i
come
too
close
and
whether
i
hit
you
or
you
hit
me
i
shall
suffer
for
it
the
strong
and
the
weak
cannot
keep
company
the
four
oxen
and
the
lion
a
lion
used
to
prowl
about
a
field
in
which
four
oxen
used
to
dwell
many
a
time
he
tried
to
attack
them
but
whenever
he
came
near
they
turned
their
tails
to
one
another
so
that
whichever
way
he
approached
them
he
was
met
by
the
horns
of
one
of
them
at
last
however
they
fell
a
quarrelling
among
themselves
and
each
went
off
to
pasture
alone
in
a
separate
corner
of
the
field
then
the
lion
attacked
them
one
by
one
and
soon
made
an
end
of
all
four
united
we
stand
divided
we
fall
the
fisher
and
the
little
fish
it
happened
that
a
fisher
after
fishing
all
day
caught
only
a
little
fish
pray
let
me
go
master
said
the
fish
i
am
much
too
small
for
your
eating
just
now
if
you
put
me
back
into
the
river
i
shall
soon
grow
then
you
can
make
a
fine
meal
off
me
nay
nay
my
little
fish
said
the
fisher
i
have
you
now
i
may
not
catch
you
hereafter
a
little
thing
in
hand
is
worth
more
than
a
great
thing
in
prospect
avaricious
and
envious
two
neighbours
came
before
jupiter
and
prayed
him
to
grant
their
hearts'
desire
now
the
one
was
full
of
avarice
and
the
other
eaten
up
with
envy
so
to
punish
them
both
jupiter
granted
that
each
might
have
whatever
he
wished
for
himself
but
only
on
condition
that
his
neighbour
had
twice
as
much
the
avaricious
man
prayed
to
have
a
room
full
of
gold
no
sooner
said
than
done
but
all
his
joy
was
turned
to
grief
when
he
found
that
his
neighbour
had
two
rooms
full
of
the
precious
metal
then
came
the
turn
of
the
envious
man
who
could
not
bear
to
think
that
his
neighbour
had
any
joy
at
all
so
he
prayed
that
he
might
have
one
of
his
own
eyes
put
out
by
which
means
his
companion
would
become
totally
blind
vices
are
their
own
punishment
the
crow
and
the
pitcher
a
crow
half
dead
with
thirst
came
upon
a
pitcher
which
had
once
been
full
of
water
but
when
the
crow
put
its
beak
into
the
mouth
of
the
pitcher
he
found
that
only
very
little
water
was
left
in
it
and
that
he
could
not
reach
far
enough
down
to
get
at
it
he
tried
and
he
tried
but
at
last
had
to
give
up
in
despair
then
a
thought
came
to
him
and
he
took
a
pebble
and
dropped
it
into
the
pitcher
then
he
took
another
pebble
and
dropped
it
into
the
pitcher
then
he
took
another
pebble
and
dropped
that
into
the
pitcher
then
he
took
another
pebble
and
dropped
that
into
the
pitcher
then
he
took
another
pebble
and
dropped
that
into
the
pitcher
then
he
took
another
pebble
and
dropped
that
into
the
pitcher
at
last
at
last
he
saw
the
water
mount
up
near
him
and
after
casting
in
a
few
more
pebbles
he
was
able
to
quench
his
thirst
and
save
his
life
little
by
little
does
the
trick
the
man
and
the
satyr
a
man
had
lost
his
way
in
a
wood
one
bitter
winter's
night
as
he
was
roaming
about
a
satyr
came
up
to
him
and
finding
that
he
had
lost
his
way
promised
to
give
him
a
lodging
for
the
night
and
guide
him
out
of
the
forest
in
the
morning
as
he
went
along
to
the
satyr's
cell
the
man
raised
both
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
kept
on
blowing
at
them
what
do
you
do
that
for
said
the
satyr
my
hands
are
numb
with
the
cold
said
the
man
and
my
breath
warms
them
after
this
they
arrived
at
the
satyr's
home
and
soon
the
satyr
put
a
smoking
dish
of
porridge
before
him
but
when
the
man
raised
his
spoon
to
his
mouth
he
began
blowing
upon
it
and
what
do
you
do
that
for
said
the
satyr
the
porridge
is
too
hot
and
my
breath
will
cool
it
out
you
go
said
the
satyr
i
will
have
nought
to
do
with
a
man
who
can
blow
hot
and
cold
with
the
same
breath
the
goose
with
the
golden
eggs
one
day
a
countryman
going
to
the
nest
of
his
goose
found
there
an
egg
all
yellow
and
glittering
when
he
took
it
up
it
was
as
heavy
as
lead
and
he
was
going
to
throw
it
away
because
he
thought
a
trick
had
been
played
upon
him
but
he
took
it
home
on
second
thoughts
and
soon
found
to
his
delight
that
it
was
an
egg
of
pure
gold
every
morning
the
same
thing
occurred
and
he
soon
became
rich
by
selling
his
eggs
as
he
grew
rich
he
grew
greedy
and
thinking
to
get
at
once
all
the
gold
the
goose
could
give
he
killed
it
and
opened
it
only
to
find
nothing
greed
oft
o'er
reaches
itself
the
labourer
and
the
nightingale
a
labourer
lay
listening
to
a
nightingale's
song
throughout
the
summer
night
so
pleased
was
he
with
it
that
the
next
night
he
set
a
trap
for
it
and
captured
it
now
that
i
have
caught
thee
he
cried
thou
shalt
always
sing
to
me
we
nightingales
never
sing
in
a
cage
said
the
bird
then
i'll
eat
thee
said
the
labourer
i
have
always
heard
say
that
a
nightingale
on
toast
is
dainty
morsel
nay
kill
me
not
said
the
nightingale
but
let
me
free
and
i'll
tell
thee
three
things
far
better
worth
than
my
poor
body
the
labourer
let
him
loose
and
he
flew
up
to
a
branch
of
a
tree
and
said
never
believe
a
captive's
promise
that's
one
thing
then
again
keep
what
you
have
and
third
piece
of
advice
is
sorrow
not
over
what
is
lost
forever
then
the
song
bird
flew
away
the
fox
the
cock
and
the
dog
one
moonlight
night
a
fox
was
prowling
about
a
farmer's
hen
coop
and
saw
a
cock
roosting
high
up
beyond
his
reach
good
news
good
news
he
cried
why
what
is
that
said
the
cock
king
lion
has
declared
a
universal
truce
no
beast
may
hurt
a
bird
henceforth
but
all
shall
dwell
together
in
brotherly
friendship
why
that
is
good
news
said
the
cock
and
there
i
see
some
one
coming
with
whom
we
can
share
the
good
tidings
and
so
saying
he
craned
his
neck
forward
and
looked
afar
off
what
is
it
you
see
said
the
fox
it
is
only
my
master's
dog
that
is
coming
towards
us
what
going
so
soon
he
continued
as
the
fox
began
to
turn
away
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
the
news
will
you
not
stop
and
congratulate
the
dog
on
the
reign
of
universal
peace
i
would
gladly
do
so
said
the
fox
but
i
fear
he
may
not
have
heard
of
king
lion's
decree
cunning
often
outwits
itself
the
wind
and
the
sun
the
wind
and
the
sun
were
disputing
which
was
the
stronger
suddenly
they
saw
a
traveller
coming
down
the
road
and
the
sun
said
i
see
a
way
to
decide
our
dispute
whichever
of
us
can
cause
that
traveller
to
take
off
his
cloak
shall
be
regarded
as
the
stronger
you
begin
so
the
sun
retired
behind
a
cloud
and
the
wind
began
to
blow
as
hard
as
it
could
upon
the
traveller
but
the
harder
he
blew
the
more
closely
did
the
traveller
wrap
his
cloak
round
him
till
at
last
the
wind
had
to
give
up
in
despair
then
the
sun
came
out
and
shone
in
all
his
glory
upon
the
traveller
who
soon
found
it
too
hot
to
walk
with
his
cloak
on
kindness
effects
more
than
severity
hercules
and
the
waggoner
a
waggoner
was
once
driving
a
heavy
load
along
a
very
muddy
way
at
last
he
came
to
a
part
of
the
road
where
the
wheels
sank
half
way
into
the
mire
and
the
more
the
horses
pulled
the
deeper
sank
the
wheels
so
the
waggoner
threw
down
his
whip
and
knelt
down
and
prayed
to
hercules
the
strong
o
hercules
help
me
in
this
my
hour
of
distress
quoth
he
but
hercules
appeared
to
him
and
said
tut
man
don't
sprawl
there
get
up
and
put
your
shoulder
to
the
wheel
the
gods
help
them
that
help
themselves
the
man
the
boy
and
the
donkey
a
man
and
his
son
were
once
going
with
their
donkey
to
market
as
they
were
walking
along
by
its
side
a
countryman
passed
them
and
said
you
fools
what
is
a
donkey
for
but
to
ride
upon
so
the
man
put
the
boy
on
the
donkey
and
they
went
on
their
way
but
soon
they
passed
a
group
of
men
one
of
whom
said
see
that
lazy
youngster
he
lets
his
father
walk
while
he
rides
so
the
man
ordered
his
boy
to
get
off
and
got
on
himself
but
they
hadn't
gone
far
when
they
passed
two
women
one
of
whom
said
to
the
other
shame
on
that
lazy
lout
to
let
his
poor
little
son
trudge
along
well
the
man
didn't
know
what
to
do
but
at
last
he
took
his
boy
up
before
him
on
the
donkey
by
this
time
they
had
come
to
the
town
and
the
passers
by
began
to
jeer
and
point
at
them
the
man
stopped
and
asked
what
they
were
scoffing
at
the
men
said
aren't
you
ashamed
of
yourself
for
overloading
that
poor
donkey
of
yoursu
and
your
hulking
son
the
man
and
boy
got
off
and
tried
to
think
what
to
do
they
thought
and
they
thought
till
at
last
they
cut
down
a
pole
tied
the
donkey's
feet
to
it
and
raised
the
pole
and
the
donkey
to
their
shoulders
they
went
along
amid
the
laughter
of
all
who
met
them
till
they
came
to
market
bridge
when
the
donkey
getting
one
of
his
feet
loose
kicked
out
and
caused
the
boy
to
drop
his
end
of
the
pole
in
the
struggle
the
donkey
fell
over
the
bridge
and
his
fore
feet
being
tied
together
he
was
drowned
that
will
teach
you
said
an
old
man
who
had
followed
them
please
all
and
you
will
please
none
the
miser
and
his
gold
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
miser
who
used
to
hide
his
gold
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
in
his
garden
but
every
week
he
used
to
go
and
dig
it
up
and
gloat
over
his
gains
a
robber
who
had
noticed
this
went
and
dug
up
the
gold
and
decamped
with
it
when
the
miser
next
came
to
gloat
over
his
treasures
he
found
nothing
but
the
empty
hole
he
tore
his
hair
and
raised
such
an
outcry
that
all
the
neighbours
came
around
him
and
he
told
them
how
he
used
to
come
and
visit
his
gold
did
you
ever
take
any
of
it
out
asked
one
of
them
nay
said
he
i
only
came
to
look
at
it
then
come
again
and
look
at
the
hole
said
a
neighbour
it
will
do
you
just
as
much
good
wealth
unused
might
as
well
not
exist
the
fox
and
the
mosquitoes
a
fox
after
crossing
a
river
got
its
tail
entangled
in
a
bush
and
could
not
move
a
number
of
mosquitoes
seeing
its
plight
settled
upon
it
and
enjoyed
a
good
meal
undisturbed
by
its
tail
a
hedgehog
strolling
by
took
pity
upon
the
fox
and
went
up
to
him
you
are
in
a
bad
way
neighbour
said
the
hedgehog
shall
i
relieve
you
by
driving
off
those
mosquitoes
who
are
sucking
your
blood
thank
you
master
hedgehog
said
the
fox
but
i
would
rather
not
why
how
is
that
asked
the
hedgehog
well
you
see
was
the
answer
these
mosquitoes
have
had
their
fill
if
you
drive
these
away
others
will
come
with
fresh
appetite
and
bleed
me
to
death
the
fox
without
a
tail
it
happened
that
a
fox
caught
its
tail
in
a
trap
and
in
struggling
to
release
himself
lost
all
of
it
but
the
stump
at
first
he
was
ashamed
to
show
himself
among
his
fellow
foxes
but
at
last
he
determined
to
put
a
bolder
face
upon
his
misfortune
and
summoned
all
the
foxes
to
a
general
meeting
to
consider
a
proposal
which
he
had
to
place
before
them
when
they
had
assembled
together
the
fox
proposed
that
they
should
all
do
away
with
their
tails
he
pointed
out
how
inconvenient
a
tail
was
when
they
were
pursued
by
their
enemies
the
dogs
how
much
it
was
in
the
way
when
they
desired
to
sit
down
and
hold
a
friendly
conversation
with
one
another
he
failed
to
see
any
advantage
in
carrying
about
such
a
useless
encumbrance
that
is
all
very
well
said
one
of
the
older
foxes
but
i
do
not
think
you
would
have
recommended
us
to
dispense
with
our
chief
ornament
if
you
had
not
happened
to
lose
it
yourself
distrust
interested
advice
the
one
eyed
doe
a
doe
had
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
one
of
her
eyes
and
could
not
see
any
one
approaching
her
on
that
side
so
to
avoid
any
danger
she
always
used
to
feed
on
a
high
cliff
near
the
sea
with
her
sound
eye
looking
towards
the
land
by
this
means
she
could
see
whenever
the
hunters
approached
her
on
land
and
often
escaped
by
this
means
but
the
hunters
found
out
that
she
was
blind
of
one
eye
and
hiring
a
boat
rowed
under
the
cliff
where
she
used
to
feed
and
shot
her
from
the
sea
ah
cried
she
with
her
dying
voice
you
cannot
escape
your
fate
belling
the
cat
long
ago
the
mice
had
a
general
council
to
consider
what
measures
they
could
take
to
outwit
their
common
enemy
the
cat
some
said
this
and
some
said
that
but
at
last
a
young
mouse
got
up
and
said
he
had
a
proposal
to
make
which
he
thought
would
meet
the
case
you
will
all
agree
said
he
that
our
chief
danger
consists
in
the
sly
and
treacherous
manner
in
which
the
enemy
approaches
us
now
if
we
could
receive
some
signal
of
her
approach
we
could
easily
escape
from
her
i
venture
therefore
to
propose
that
a
small
bell
be
procured
and
attached
by
a
ribbon
round
the
neck
of
the
cat
by
this
means
we
should
always
know
when
she
was
about
and
could
easily
retire
while
she
was
in
the
neighbourhood
this
proposal
met
with
general
applause
until
an
old
mouse
got
up
and
said
that
is
all
very
well
but
who
is
to
bell
the
cat
the
mice
looked
at
one
another
and
nobody
spoke
then
the
old
mouse
said
it
is
easy
to
propose
impossible
remedies
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
the
hare
was
once
boasting
of
his
speed
before
the
other
animals
i
have
never
yet
been
beaten
said
he
when
i
put
forth
my
full
speed
i
challenge
any
one
here
to
race
with
me
the
tortoise
said
quietly
i
accept
your
challenge
that
is
a
good
joke
said
the
hare
i
could
dance
round
you
all
the
way
keep
your
boasting
till
you've
beaten
answered
the
tortoise
shall
we
race
so
a
course
was
fixed
and
a
start
was
made
the
hare
darted
almost
out
of
sight
at
once
but
soon
stopped
and
to
show
his
contempt
for
the
tortoise
lay
down
to
have
a
nap
the
tortoise
plodded
on
and
plodded
on
and
when
the
hare
awoke
from
his
nap
he
saw
the
tortoise
just
near
the
winning
post
and
could
not
run
up
in
time
to
save
the
race
then
said
the
tortoise
plodding
wins
the
race
the
old
man
and
death
an
old
labourer
bent
double
with
age
and
toil
was
gathering
sticks
in
a
forest
at
last
he
grew
so
tired
and
hopeless
that
he
threw
down
the
bundle
of
sticks
and
cried
out
i
cannot
bear
this
life
any
longer
ah
i
wish
death
would
only
come
and
take
me
as
he
spoke
death
a
grisly
skeleton
appeared
and
said
to
him
what
wouldst
thou
mortal
i
heard
thee
call
me
please
sir
replied
the
woodcutter
would
you
kindly
help
me
to
lift
this
faggot
of
sticks
on
to
my
shoulder
we
would
often
be
sorry
if
our
wishes
were
gratified
the
hare
with
many
friends
a
hare
was
very
popular
with
the
other
beasts
who
all
claimed
to
be
her
friends
but
one
day
she
heard
the
hounds
approaching
and
hoped
to
escape
them
by
the
aid
of
her
many
friends
so
she
went
to
the
horse
and
asked
him
to
carry
her
away
from
the
hounds
on
his
back
but
he
declined
stating
that
he
had
important
work
to
do
for
his
master
he
felt
sure
he
said
that
all
her
other
friends
would
come
to
her
assistance
she
then
applied
to
the
bull
and
hoped
that
he
would
repel
the
hounds
with
his
horns
the
bull
replied
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
have
an
appointment
with
a
lady
but
i
feel
sure
that
our
friend
the
goat
will
do
what
you
want
the
goat
however
feared
that
his
back
might
do
her
some
harm
if
he
took
her
upon
it
the
ram
he
felt
sure
was
the
proper
friend
to
apply
to
so
she
went
to
the
ram
and
told
him
the
case
the
ram
replied
another
time
my
dear
friend
i
do
not
like
to
interfere
on
the
present
occasion
as
hounds
have
been
known
to
eat
sheep
as
well
as
hares
the
hare
then
applied
as
a
last
hope
to
the
calf
who
regretted
that
he
was
unable
to
help
her
as
he
did
not
like
to
take
the
responsibility
upon
himself
as
so
many
older
persons
than
himself
had
declined
the
task
by
this
time
the
hounds
were
quite
near
and
the
hare
took
to
her
heels
and
luckily
escaped
he
that
has
many
friends
has
no
friends
the
lion
in
love
a
lion
once
fell
in
love
with
a
beautiful
maiden
and
proposed
marriage
to
her
parents
the
old
people
did
not
know
what
to
say
they
did
not
like
to
give
their
daughter
to
the
lion
yet
they
did
not
wish
to
enrage
the
king
of
beasts
at
last
the
father
said
we
feel
highly
honoured
by
your
majesty's
proposal
but
you
see
our
daughter
is
a
tender
young
thing
and
we
fear
that
in
the
vehemence
of
your
affection
you
might
possibly
do
her
some
injury
might
i
venture
to
suggest
that
your
majesty
should
have
your
claws
removed
and
your
teeth
extracted
then
we
would
gladly
consider
your
proposal
again
the
lion
was
so
much
in
love
that
he
had
his
claws
trimmed
and
his
big
teeth
taken
out
but
when
he
came
again
to
the
parents
of
the
young
girl
they
simply
laughed
in
his
face
and
bade
him
do
his
worst
love
can
tame
the
wildest
the
bundle
of
sticks
an
old
man
on
the
point
of
death
summoned
his
sons
around
him
to
give
them
some
parting
advice
he
ordered
his
servants
to
bring
in
a
faggot
of
sticks
and
said
to
his
eldest
son
break
it
the
son
strained
and
strained
but
with
all
his
efforts
was
unable
to
break
the
bundle
the
other
sons
also
tried
but
none
of
them
was
successful
untie
the
faggots
said
the
father
and
each
of
you
take
a
stick
when
they
had
done
so
he
called
out
to
them
now
break
and
each
stick
was
easily
broken
you
see
my
meaning
said
their
father
union
gives
strength
the
lion
the
fox
and
the
beasts
the
lion
once
gave
out
that
he
was
sick
unto
death
and
summoned
the
animals
to
come
and
hear
his
last
will
and
testament
so
the
goat
came
to
the
lion's
cave
and
stopped
there
listening
for
a
long
time
then
a
sheep
went
in
and
before
she
came
out
a
calf
came
up
to
receive
the
last
wishes
of
the
lord
of
the
beasts
but
soon
the
lion
seemed
to
recover
and
came
to
the
mouth
of
his
cave
and
saw
the
fox
who
had
been
waiting
outside
for
some
time
why
do
you
not
come
to
pay
your
respects
to
me
said
the
lion
to
the
fox
i
beg
your
majesty's
pardon
said
the
fox
but
i
noticed
the
track
of
the
animals
that
have
already
come
to
you
and
while
i
see
many
hoof
marks
going
in
i
see
none
coming
out
till
the
animals
that
have
entered
your
cave
come
out
again
i
prefer
to
remain
in
the
open
air
it
is
easier
to
get
into
the
enemy's
toils
than
out
again
the
ass's
brains
the
lion
and
the
fox
went
hunting
together
the
lion
on
the
advice
of
the
fox
sent
a
message
to
the
ass
proposing
to
make
an
alliance
between
their
two
families
the
ass
came
to
the
place
of
meeting
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
a
royal
alliance
but
when
he
came
there
the
lion
simply
pounced
on
the
ass
and
said
to
the
fox
here
is
our
dinner
for
to
day
watch
you
here
while
i
go
and
have
a
nap
woe
betide
you
if
you
touch
my
prey
the
lion
went
away
and
the
fox
waited
but
finding
that
his
master
did
not
return
ventured
to
take
out
the
brains
of
the
ass
and
ate
them
up
when
the
lion
came
back
he
soon
noticed
the
absence
of
the
brains
and
asked
the
fox
in
a
terrible
voice
what
have
you
done
with
the
brains
brains
your
majesty
it
had
none
or
it
would
never
have
fallen
into
your
trap
wit
has
always
an
answer
ready
the
eagle
and
the
arrow
an
eagle
was
soaring
through
the
air
when
suddenly
it
heard
the
whizz
of
an
arrow
and
felt
itself
wounded
to
death
slowly
it
fluttered
down
to
the
earth
with
its
life
blood
pouring
out
of
it
looking
down
upon
the
arrow
with
which
it
had
been
pierced
it
found
that
the
shaft
of
the
arrow
had
been
feathered
with
one
of
its
own
plumes
alas
it
cried
as
it
died
we
often
give
our
enemies
the
means
for
our
own
destruction
the
milkmaid
and
her
pail
patty
the
milkmaid
was
going
to
market
carrying
her
milk
in
a
pail
on
her
head
as
she
went
along
she
began
calculating
what
she
would
do
with
the
money
she
would
get
for
the
milk
i'll
buy
some
fowls
from
farmer
brown
said
she
and
they
will
lay
eggs
each
morning
which
i
will
sell
to
the
parson's
wife
with
the
money
that
i
get
from
the
sale
of
these
eggs
i'll
buy
myself
a
new
dimity
frock
and
a
chip
hat
and
when
i
go
to
market
won't
all
the
young
men
come
up
and
speak
to
me
polly
shaw
will
be
that
jealous
but
i
don't
care
i
shall
just
look
at
her
and
toss
my
head
like
this
as
she
spoke
she
tossed
her
head
back
the
pail
fell
off
it
and
all
the
milk
was
spilt
so
she
had
to
go
home
and
tell
her
mother
what
had
occurred
ah
my
child
said
the
mother
do
not
count
your
chickens
before
they
are
hatched
the
cat
maiden
the
gods
were
once
disputing
whether
it
was
possible
for
a
living
being
to
change
its
nature
jupiter
said
yes
but
venus
said
no
so
to
try
the
question
jupiter
turned
a
cat
into
a
maiden
and
gave
her
to
a
young
man
for
a
wife
the
wedding
was
duly
performed
and
the
young
couple
sat
down
to
the
wedding
feast
see
said
jupiter
to
venus
how
becomingly
she
behaves
who
could
tell
that
yesterday
she
was
but
a
cat
surely
her
nature
is
changed
wait
a
minute
replied
venus
and
let
loose
a
mouse
into
the
room
no
sooner
did
the
bride
see
this
than
she
jumped
up
from
her
seat
and
tried
to
pounce
upon
the
mouse
ah
you
see
said
venus
nature
will
out
the
horse
and
the
ass
a
horse
and
an
ass
were
travelling
together
the
horse
prancing
along
in
its
fine
trappings
the
ass
carrying
with
difficulty
the
heavy
weight
in
its
panniers
i
wish
i
were
you
sighed
the
ass
nothing
to
do
and
well
fed
and
all
that
fine
harness
upon
you
next
day
however
there
was
a
great
battle
and
the
horse
was
wounded
to
death
in
the
final
charge
of
the
day
his
friend
the
ass
happened
to
pass
by
shortly
afterwards
and
found
him
on
the
point
of
death
i
was
wrong
said
the
ass
better
humble
security
than
gilded
danger
the
trumpeter
taken
prisoner
a
trumpeter
during
a
battle
ventured
too
near
the
enemy
and
was
captured
by
them
they
were
about
to
proceed
to
put
him
to
death
when
he
begged
them
to
hear
his
plea
for
mercy
i
do
not
fight
said
he
and
indeed
carry
no
weapon
i
only
blow
this
trumpet
and
surely
that
cannot
harm
you
then
why
should
you
kill
me
you
may
not
fight
yourself
said
the
others
but
you
encourage
and
guide
your
men
to
the
fight
words
may
be
deeds
the
buffoon
and
the
countryman
at
a
country
fair
there
was
a
buffoon
who
made
all
the
people
laugh
by
imitating
the
cries
of
various
animals
he
finished
off
by
squeaking
so
like
a
pig
that
the
spectators
thought
that
he
had
a
porker
concealed
about
him
but
a
countryman
who
stood
by
said
call
that
a
pig
s
squeak
nothing
like
it
you
give
me
till
tomorrow
and
i
will
show
you
what
it's
like
the
audience
laughed
but
next
day
sure
enough
the
countryman
appeared
on
the
stage
and
putting
his
head
down
squealed
so
hideously
that
the
spectators
hissed
and
threw
stones
at
him
to
make
him
stop
you
fools
he
cried
see
what
you
have
been
hissing
and
held
up
a
little
pig
whose
ear
he
had
been
pinching
to
make
him
utter
the
squeals
men
often
applaud
an
imitation
and
hiss
the
real
thing
the
old
woman
and
the
wine
jar
you
must
know
that
sometimes
old
women
like
a
glass
of
wine
one
of
this
sort
once
found
a
wine
jar
lying
in
the
road
and
eagerly
went
up
to
it
hoping
to
find
it
full
but
when
she
took
it
up
she
found
that
all
the
wine
had
been
drunk
out
of
it
still
she
took
a
long
sniff
at
the
mouth
of
the
jar
ah
she
cried
what
memories
cling
'round
the
instruments
of
our
pleasure
the
fox
and
the
goat
by
an
unlucky
chance
a
fox
fell
into
a
deep
well
from
which
he
could
not
get
out
a
goat
passed
by
shortly
afterwards
and
asked
the
fox
what
he
was
doing
down
there
oh
have
you
not
heard
said
the
fox
there
is
going
to
be
a
great
drought
so
i
jumped
down
here
in
order
to
be
sure
to
have
water
by
me
why
don't
you
come
down
too
the
goat
thought
well
of
this
advice
and
jumped
down
into
the
well
but
the
fox
immediately
jumped
on
her
back
and
by
putting
his
foot
on
her
long
horns
managed
to
jump
up
to
the
edge
of
the
well
good
bye
friend
said
the
fox
remember
next
time
never
trust
the
advice
of
a
man
in
difficulties
